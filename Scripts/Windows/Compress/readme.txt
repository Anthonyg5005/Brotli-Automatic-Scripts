This batch file is setup to use Brotli as if it's installed.

To install Brotli, first you need to put it anywhere that won't be deleted. I recommend putting it under "C:\Program Files"

Next you open search and search for "Environment Variables" then open.

On the system properties window, click 'Environment Variables'

Find 'Path' under System variables and open that.

Click new and add the path to the Brotli bin folder.
For example: C:\Program Files\Brotli\bin


IGNORE IF YOU USE WINDOWS 11
I Would also reccomend installing Tar. This one is more simple. Move the Tar.exe file to C:\Windows


Now you should be able to open command prompt and type 'tar' or 'brotli' and it should work from anywhere.
